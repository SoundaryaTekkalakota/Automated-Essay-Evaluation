Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benifit us in many ways like talking and becoming friends will others through websites like myspace and facebook. Using computers can help us find coordinates, locations, and able ourselves to millions of information. Also computers will benifit us by helping with jobs as in planning a house plan and typing a @NUM1 page report for one of our jobs in less than writing it. Now let us go into the wonder world of technology. using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line. Many people has Myspace, Facebook aim all benefits us by having conversations with one another. Many people believe computers are bad but how can you make freinds if you can never talk to them? i am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but also my social life and how i make freinds. computers help us with finding our locations, coordinates and millions of information online. If we didn't go on the internet a lot we wouldn't know how to go onto websites that @MONTH1 help us with locations and coordinates like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be in @LOCATION3.when you are supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2. Millions of information is found on the internet. You can as almost every question and a computer will have it. Would you rather easily draw up a house plan on the computers or take @NUM1 hours doing one by hand with ugly eraser marks all over it, Many people don't like writing @NUM3 words non-stop for hours when it could take them I have a computer. That is why computers we need a lot now a days. I hope this essay has impacted your decision on computers because they are great machines to work with. The other day I showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention sense sliced bread. So Now go out and buy a computer to help you chat online with freinds, find locations and millions of information on one click of the button and help yourself with getting a job with neat, prepared, printed work that your boss will love.
